The two datasets used in this experiment are van de Vijver et al (2002) and Wang et al
(2005). 

But these expression profiles obtained from primary breast tumors were hybridized to different micro array platforms.

van de Vijver(2002) to Hu25K 
Wang(2005) to HG-U133a 

The analysis is restricted to 8141 genes which are present in both data sets. 


				Metastatis 		Non-metastasis  	Total  
van de Vijver 		78				217				 295
	
Wang  				106 			180 			 286 

Summary 

van - 295 Samples = Hu25K
Wang - 286 Samples = HG-U133a
